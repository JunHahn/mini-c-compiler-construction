# 1.1. Programming Languages

## Good Programming Languages?
  
* Clear Concepts
  * syntax
  * semantics
* Represent thoughts/purposes of programmer naturally
* Portability, reliability, modularisation, effectiveness
* Decent scalability
* Good programming environment

## Cobol

* COmmon Business Oriented Language
* Released by CODASYL in early 1960s
* Mainly used for business purpose
* defined ANSI COBOL from 1968 to 1974

## FORTRAN

* FORmula TRANslation
* Developed by J. Backus and his team, in early 1960
* a programming language for scientific calculation
* Released FORTRAN77 in 1977

## ALGOL

* ALGOrithmic Language
* ALGOL68: released by IFIP WG2.1 in 1968
* represent grammatical structure as [formal grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar)
* influences many other programming languages

## Pascal

* introduced by N. Wirth in early 1970s
* designed with the perspective of programming language theory
* suitable for applicaiton of computer science: data structure, algorithm 

## Ada

* released by Department of Defense in 1980
* reliability, simplicity, modularity, efficiency
* package, generic features, multi-tasking
* good for real-time applications

## C++

* introduced by B. Stroustrup, in 1983
* OOPL (Object-Oriented Programming Language): class, **inheritance**, polymorphism

## Java

* J. Gosling from Sun MicroSystems
* OOPL, exception, multithread
* Internet & distributed environment
* Applet, Application

## C#

* J. Gough from Microsoft
* **.NET** Framework, OOPL
* JIT (Just In-Time Compilation)
* MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)
* CLR (Common Language Runtime)
* Expressiveness and simplicity
